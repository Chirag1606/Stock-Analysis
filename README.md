# Stock-Analysis

Stock Data of 3 largest Private sector banks(In terms of Market Cap) was web scrapped and analysed using EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)
The goal of this project was- 
a) To find an undervalued stock which can give good returns in future and 
b) A growth Stock which is currently giving good returns and will continue giving consistent returns.4

Both Stocks have their own Pros abd Cons. 
Undervalued Stock will not yield good returns in the present times but might shoot up and give huge returns in the future. 
The Growth Stock will continue giving 10-14% of return every year. 

ICICI Bank Comes out to be a Undervalued Stock 
HDFC Bank is a growth stock
